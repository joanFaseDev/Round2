# Quote Guess

## About

This project is about buildind a small-scope application using HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and SASS as I wish to get familiar with the latter. The application should displayed multiple famous quotes, each split in half. First halfs will be to the left of the screen and second halfs will be to the right. The goal will be for the user to find the first and second half of the quote then to validate its choice by clicking in succession on the first then second half. Once all parts have been clicked, good and bad answers will be highlighted then Users will have the choice to start a new game.
