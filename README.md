# 100 Days of Code - Round 2

## Day 1 - July 15, 2023

I started my first project for this round 2 of the 100 days of code challenge, which is a small-scoped application using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript where a user must guess the authors of various famous quotes.
I set up Sass and am using this project to get familiar with the 'module' thing introduced in ES6. For now, I have a list of quotes that I can randomly sort and display on screen.
Tomorrow I'll work on a way to select a quote and then an author to associate them as a user's answer/input.
